          I am student at the University of Minnesota becoming a full stack
          developer. I am also currently working at Alarm.com as a Support
          Operations Associate. In my current roll I work with security
          professionals over the phone to find creative solutions to complex
          issues and situations.

          Before my current job I lived in the Philippines fo 2 years helping
          out a non-profit starting up a screen printing and sewing shop. During
          that time I also worked with LSJ collective working as a marketing
          strategist. I would edit and create videos and visual content using
          Adobe photoshop, premiere pro and after effects. Before starting both
          of those positions I didn’t have any experience with Adobe or working
          textiles. I had to learn on the job which was my favorite part about
          those positions. I am looking for a job that pushes me and helps me
          grow and learn more about this exciting field.
